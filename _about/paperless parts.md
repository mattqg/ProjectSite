 Paperless Parts is a software company working to redefine the manufacturing space. My role involves coding geometrically-driven quoting software for job shops. I utilize python to implement quoting logic for quickly and accurately driving the price of manufactured parts.

 I have worked with shops to automate quoting for sheet metal fabrication, CNC milling and turning, and additive manufacturing. Throgh the work, I have gotten a deeper understanding of what drives the cost of a part and how machine shops of all sizes operate.
