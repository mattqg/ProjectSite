Many satelites (Kepler, FUSE, Dawn, Hayabusa) have suffered failure of reaction wheels due to bearing failures. The Correlated Electromagnetic Levitation Actuator (CELA) aims to replace conventional reaction wheels with an electromagnetically levitating actuator.

I worked on advancing the current prototype for CELA, including determining and documenting design goals and designing custom parts to manufacture prototypes. I also worked across subteams to assist with project management and documentation tasks, including an overall project report and video for grant funding submission.
