<p style="font-size:15px; padding: 0 0 1em 0;">May, 2021</p>

For my mechatronics class, I wanted to design a unique machine from scratch and to learn by doing. Therefore, I set out to design and build a machine capable of placing Lego bricks to build a structure built in Lego CAD. This project served as a lerning process for designing and integrating a complex system with a short timeline.

Key elements of this project include the design of the 3-axis motion platform, the design of the end effector, the esp32-based electronics, the machine control code in grbl, and the custom pipeline from Lego CAD to G-code.

 The machine is currently being redesigned into a 2D machine capable of generating custom <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/art" target="_blank">Lego Art.</a>
