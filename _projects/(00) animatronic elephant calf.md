#### <b>Animatronic Elephant Calf</b>
<p style="font-size:15px; padding: 0 0 1em 0;">October 25, 2020</p>

For my senior design project, I am working on a developing an animatronic elephant calf for an upcoming expansion at the Nashville Zoo. I chose this project because it is in its very early stages of development. Every single aspect of the design, from mechanical to electrical to software will be completely defined by our senior design team. This gives a lot of room for creative design solutions across disciplines, which I really enjoy.

Our first constraint given to the team by the Nashville Zoo was that the elephant needed to be accurately scaled to a baby African Elephant, which is approximately 1 meter tall. Since it is difficult to get the accurate sizes of every part of the elephent, I decided to make a model to use for dimensioning. I worked in Blender with multiple reference images, and ended up with the model shown below. The file was exported as a .step, and imported directly into Solidworks for reference.

</model-viewer>

Our group split into subteams, and I took over the design of the elephant's head, neck, trunk, and eyes. I began by designing a neck mechanism which allowed for three rotational degrees of freedom, shown below.


I am currently working on the design of the trunk, and the current prototype can be seen below.
