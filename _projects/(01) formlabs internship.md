At Formlabs, I helped develop the next generation of 3D printing technologies. 

I primarily worked on redesigning a testing jig for the factory calibration of the Form 3 SLA printer. Challenges included CAD design, GD&T, and coding the testing script in python.

I also worked on material testing where I assembled an electromechanical mechanism to test material properties under various conditions. I created a script which ran the test, collected data, and instantly visualized those data from hundreds of experimental trials.
