During my sophomore summer, I worked to develop 3D printing technologies at [Formlabs](https://www.formlabs.com). The company has an annual hackathon, and our office decided to utilize the three days to create a wood laminated sheet printer. This idea came from a simple desire: a wooden benchy. For those who donâ€™t know, a benchy is a test part used in 3D printers to benchmark their performance.

This page is a work in progress, but the project was documented well by the video below, by [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2019/07/25/3d-printer-meets-cnc-router-to-make-wood-prints/), and by [Arduino](https://blog.arduino.cc/2019/07/26/plywood-printer-uses-a-unique-mix-of-manufacturing-methods/).
