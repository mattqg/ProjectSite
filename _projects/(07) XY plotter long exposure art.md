#### <b>LED Plotter Painting<b>
<p style="font-size:15px; padding: 0 0 1em 0;">April, 2019</p>

During my time at Vanderbilt, I worked a lot with <a href="https://www.artlabvanderbilt.com/" target="_blank">Artlab</a>, a space which explores the intersection of engineering, science, scientific communication, and art. For their exhibition titled "Lights, Lasers, and Lenses", I created an artwork utilizing my machine design and coding skills. 

I built an XY plotter with an LED for the end-effector. With python control software linked to inkscape image paths, I was able to move an LED along the outlines of images. The final deliverables were then created using a camera set on a long-exposure as the path was traced with light. The machine is shown in action below with the long-exposure shots shown further down.
