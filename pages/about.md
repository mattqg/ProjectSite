Hello and welcome to my site! My name is Matt and I like to make stuff. I am a mechanical enigneer based in Cambridge, MA who enjoys working at the intersection of technologies while continuously growing and learning.
<br><br>

I have worked on mechanical engineering teams at NASA and Formlabs and am currently developing geometry-driven quoting software for job shops at Paperless Parts.
<br><br>

I would love to hear from you, whether you want to chat about projects or are looking for someone to join your team. Here is my [resume](/resume.pdf), and my email is me (at) mattqg (dot) com
