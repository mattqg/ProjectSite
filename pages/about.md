I am an engineer, inventor, coder, and artist interested in mechanical design, robotics, product development, creative coding, themed entertainment, and kinetic art. I enjoy constantly learning new things and connecting concepts from different fields to solve complex problems. 
<br><br>

I have been lucky to have worked with and learned from some amazing teams. I developed understanding of manufacturing processes through my time  designing calibration tools for the Formlabs Form 3. I tested my rapid prototyping skills through the development of a magnetically levitated reaction sphere at NASA. I explored user interaction and haptic feedback within augmented and virtual reality systems for two years in the Robotics and Autonomous Systems Lab at Vanderbilt. I discovered the intersection of art and engineering by developing kinetic artwork with the Vanderbilt ArtLab program.

I would love to hear from you, whether you want to talk more about the projects here, or are looking for someone to join your team. Here is my [resume](/mattqg_resume.pdf), and you can reach me through my [email](mailto:me@mattqg.com).
